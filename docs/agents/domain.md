# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Layout

This repo uses a single-context layout:

- `CONTEXT.md` at the repo root for the project glossary and domain language.
- `docs/adr/` for architectural decision records.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root, if it exists.
- **`docs/adr/`** -- read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in, if they exist.

If any of these files don't exist, proceed silently. Don't flag their absence; don't suggest creating them upfront. The producer skill (`/grill-with-docs`) creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## File structure

```text
/
|-- CONTEXT.md
|-- docs/
|   `-- adr/
|       |-- 0001-example-decision.md
|       `-- 0002-example-decision.md
|-- apps/
`-- packages/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept in an issue title, refactor proposal, hypothesis, or test name, use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal: either you're inventing language the project doesn't use, or there's a real gap to note for `/grill-with-docs`.

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding it.
